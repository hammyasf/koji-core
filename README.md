# @withkoji/core

## Testing this package from github

Inside your project's root folder, run `npm install madewithkoji/koji-core`. 

You should then be able to `import Koji, { KojiBackend } from '@withkoji/core` inside of your frontend and backend.

## Develop

Clone this repo and `cd new-koji-package`
`npm install`
`npm run watch`

Note that if you are testing declarations you will need to run `npm run generate-declarations` to get the new values as these aren't automatically compiled in the watcher.
